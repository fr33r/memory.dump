## Applying REST

### What is REST?

REST is a software architecture devised by Roy Fielding, and stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. If you haven't done so, I highly recommend taking a deep dive into Fielding's PhD dissertation where he articulates what the REST architecture is.

If you are looking for a quick way to get up to speed on it, glance over my summarization of chapter 5 in his dissertation here.

Not feeling that either? Here is all I will give you for your laziness:

> REST is not a protocol, a file format, or a development framework. It's a set fo design constraints: statelessness, hypermedia as the engine of application state, and so on. Collectively, we call these the _Fielding constraints_, because they were first identified in Roy T. Fielding's 2000 dissertation on software architecture, which gathered them together under the name "REST". **-Page 29. RESTful Web APIs**

Many of use have only heard the term "REST" or "RESTful" in the context of web API's. It is easy to see how one could confuse the REST architecture to only be for web API's.

However, REST is something much larger. It is the architecture of the __W__orld __W__ide __W__eb as we know it today.

That's right, you've been using systems that implement the RESTful architecture and you didn't even know it. This is perhaps one of the most important concepts to realize when starting to learn about REST. It is the formalization and the coagulation of a design process that is currently implemented by the web.

Due to this, I have a strong feeling that you are fluent in several parts of the REST simply because you use the web every day and have for years.
